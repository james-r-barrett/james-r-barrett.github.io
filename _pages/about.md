I am a post-doctoral research associate in the [Mackinder lab](https://mackinderlab.weebly.com/) at the University of York. I completed my Ph.D in November 2023, presenting a thesis entitled "*Convergent and concurrent evolution of a promiscuous mechanism to phase separate eukaryotic carbon fixation*". During this time, I was lucky to be supervised by Professor Luke Mackinder and Professor Mark Leake, who encouraged a 'blue-sky' approach to science. This allowed me to develop my interests at the interface of pyrenoid biology, synthetic biology and plant engineering.

## Interests
My main interest is in characterising pyrenoid components and their evolution with a view to understanding how they can be used to guide synthetic biology engineering approaches in plants.

## Funding
I am currently funded by the Carbon Technology Research Foundation (CTRF) as part of a collaborative project with the University of Princeton and University of Edinburgh. We aim to build on a recent discovery of a promiscuous pyrenoid linker protein from _Chlorella sorokiniana_ to develop a "_Universal strategy for pyrenoid-based CO2-
concentrating mechanism engineering to enhance CO2 capture in plants and algae._"
