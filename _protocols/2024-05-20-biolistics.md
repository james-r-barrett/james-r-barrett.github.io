## Description
Standard protocol for the transformation of the *Chlamydomonas reinhardtii* chloroplast using biolistic particle bombardment. Adapted from a protocol shared by the lab of <a href="https://www.plantsci.cam.ac.uk/directory/smith-alison">Alison Smith (University of Cambridge)</a>.

### Before starting
- The minimum concentration your plasmid can be for good transformation efficiency is **75 ng &#181;L<sup>-1</sup>**.


## Protocol
### Preparing cells for shooting
1. Grow cells to mid-exponential phase (2-8x10<sup>6</sup> cells mL<sup>-1</sup>).
1. Centrifuge (1000 *g*, 5 minutes, RT) and resuspend to 1x10<sup>8</sup> cells mL<sup>-1</sup> in TAP media.
1. Plate 50-100 &#181;L (5-10x10<sup>6</sup>) cells in the centre of a TAP plate (100 mm petri dish). Manipulate the plate such that the cells occupy a circular area with a radius of &sim;2 cm.
1. Allow plates to dry.
   1. Cells can be transformed biolistically as soon as they are dry on the plate. Do not attempt to shoot prior to drying, as very poor efficiency will be observed in 'damp' regions.
   1. Alternatviely, the plated cells can be incubated in low light for several hours or overnight. Don't let cells grow longer than this, as it will affect the selection process after shooting.

### Preparing DNA-coated nanoparticles
1. Resuspend gold nanoparticles by flicking the tube, vortexing (&sim;10 seconds) and briefly sonicating (&sim;1 minute) in an ultrasonic bath.
1. Aliquot 0.5 mg of gold nanoparticles (10 &#181;L; usually supplied as a 50 mg mL<sup>-1</sup> suspension) for each biolistic transformation into 1.5 mL eppendorfs.
1. Add 500-1000 ng of plasmid DNA per transformation.
1. Add water such that the final gold concentration is 30 mg mL<sup>-1</sup>.
   1. For a single transformation, the final volume should be 16.6 &#181;L, of which 10 &#181;L is gold.
1. Add an equal volume of precipitation buffer, vortex briefly (&sim;10 seconds) and let stand at RT for 3 minutes.
1. Centrifuge for 5 seconds at 7,500 *g*.
