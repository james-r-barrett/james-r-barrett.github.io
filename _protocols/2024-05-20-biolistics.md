## **Description**<br>
Standard protocol for the transformation of the *Chlamydomonas reinhardtii* chloroplast using biolistic particle bombardment.

## **Protocol**
### Preparing cells for shooting
1. Grow cells to mid-exponential phase (2-8x10<sup>6</sup> cells mL<sup>-1</sup>).
1. Centrifuge (1000 *g*, 5 minutes, RT) and resuspend to 1x10<sup>8</sup> cells mL<sup>-1</sup> in TAP media.
1. Plate 50-100 &#181;L (5-10x10<sup>7</sup>) cells in the centre of a TAP plate (100 mm petri dish). Manipulate the plate such that the cells occupy a circular area with a radius of &sim;2 cm.
1. Allow plates to dry.
   1. Cells can be transformed biolistically as soon as they are dry on the plate.
   1. Alternatviely the plated cells can be incubated in low light for several hours or overnight. Don't let cells outgrow longer than this, as it will affect the selection process.

### Preparing DNA-coated nanoparticles
