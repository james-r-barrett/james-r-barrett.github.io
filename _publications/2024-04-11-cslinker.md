**Abstract**

CO<sub>2</sub> fixation is commonly limited by inefficiency of the CO<sub>2</sub>-fixing enzyme Rubisco. Eukaryotic algae concentrate and fix CO<sub>2</sub> in phase-separated condensates called pyrenoids, which complete up to one-third of global CO<sub>2</sub> fixation. Condensation of Rubisco in pyrenoids is dependent on interaction with disordered linker proteins that show little conservation between species. We developed a sequence-independent bioinformatic pipeline to identify linker proteins in green algae. We report the linker from <i>Chlorella</i> and demonstrate that it binds a conserved site on the Rubisco large subunit. We show the <i>Chlorella</i> linker phase separates <i>Chlamydomonas</i> Rubisco and that despite their separation by âˆ¼800 million years of evolution, the Chlorella linker can support the formation of a functional pyrenoid in <i>Chlamydomonas</i>. This cross-species reactivity extends to plants, with the <i>Chlorella</i> linker able to drive condensation of some native plant Rubiscos in vitro and in planta. Our results represent an exciting frontier for pyrenoid engineering in plants, which is modelled to increase crop yields.
